# DECT ULE StarterKit Test Project

This project is dedicated to testing DECT ULE (Ultra Low Energy) technology using the available StarterKit hardware. It leverages libraries and tools provided by the DSP Group,
as referenced in the [ule-starterkit v1.0 release](https://github.com/DSPGroup/ule-starterkit/releases/tag/v1.0). 
The main goal is to evaluate and validate DECT ULE features and performance in a controlled environment.
