This is a Single threaded application example of MCU software of device sending raw data with UART Rx interrupt without Operation System.

Description
-----------
This directory contains a set of source files that implements a simple Voice Call application. This application provides following MCU functional:
 - send raw FUN message
 
User can press the button on stm32 device to do this action: 
 - send raw FUN message

Hardware and Software environment
---------------------------------
  - This example runs on NUCLEO-L476RG device.
  - This application has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-L476RG Rev C
  - STM32LXxx-Nucleo Set-up    
  - Connect the Nucleo board to your PC with a USB cable type A to mini-B 
    to ST-LINK connector (CN1 / CN7 on B-L072Z-LRWAN1).
  - Please ensure that the ST-LINK connector CN2 (CN8 on B-L072Z-LRWAN1) jumpers are fitted.

How to use it ?
---------------
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
  - Open your preferred toolchain 
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Run the example
  - Install dhan shield to STM32L4 (must already be registered to a hub before)
  - Press button to send raw FUN message
