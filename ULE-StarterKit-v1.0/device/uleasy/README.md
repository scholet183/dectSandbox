The CMND API protocol is used to interact between MCU and DECT module. This library implements the CMND API protocol services and commands and allows the user to focus on using the API instead of learning the bits and bytes of the CMND API protocol.

This library allows the user to create and parse CMND messages. Handling the transport (e.g. UART) is left to the user.
